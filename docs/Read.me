# Vehicle Management System

## Project Overview
This project is a simple Java program that shows basic Object-Oriented
Programming concepts.
The program works with different types of vehicles and drivers.

The main goal of this project is to practice inheritance, abstraction,
and working with objects in Java.

## Used OOP Concepts

### Inheritance
The class `Vehicle` is a parent class.
The classes `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and `Truck` are child classes.
They inherit common fields like brand and year from `Vehicle`.

### Abstraction
`Vehicle` is an abstract class.
It has abstract methods `startEngine()` and `stopEngine()`.
Each vehicle class implements these methods in its own way.

### Composition and Aggregation
Each vehicle has a driver.
One driver can be used for more than one vehicle.

## Class List
- Vehicle (abstract)
- Car
- Motorcycle
- Truck
- Driver
- Main

## Program Behavior
The program creates several vehicles and drivers.
All vehicles are stored in an array.
Using a loop, the program starts the engine, shows vehicle information,
shows driver information, and stops the engine.

---

## Reflection
Inheritance made the program simpler because common code is written
only once in the parent class.
Method overriding helped each vehicle have its own behavior.
The most difficult part was understanding abstract classes and how
to use the `super` keyword.
